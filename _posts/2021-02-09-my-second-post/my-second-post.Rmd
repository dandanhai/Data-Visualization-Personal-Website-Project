# a.	Critique of Data Visualization
```{r, out.width='70%',fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('picture/example.png')
```

### **Clarity**
- Apart from Strongly Agree and Strongly Disagree, the other three categories are not expressed, so accurate information cannot be obtained.

- As 100% stacked bar chart, comparing the middle three categories among those countries are difficult.

- Reading the percentage value of strongly disagree is difficult

- Reading the percentage value of the sum of strongly disagree and category 4 is difficult

- As 100% stacked bar chart, it is not clear how much support each country has for vaccines

### **Aesthetic**

- The distribution of the colors is not consistent enough. Strongly Agree/Strongly Agree should be used more brighten color.

- Legend on the right top corner is vague.

- It is not a excellent data visualization since I want to compare different country's opinion on pro-vaccine. So I believe it is better to change to diverging stacked bar chart in the view of comparison.

# b.	Way to Improve Current Design
### **Improve from Clarity**

- Add agree/ neutral/disagree to legend at the far left to convenient the audience to understand

- Diverging stacked bar chart is more suitable with the comparison

### **Improve from Aesthetics**

- Use a more distinct color, gradient from red to dark blue

- It is recommended to use diverging stacked bar chart and create Gantt Percent, which can represent the each category with better data visualization.

### **Sketch of Proposed Design** 


```{r, out.width='80%',fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('picture/sketch.jpeg')
```
- First of all, we can clearly see from the figure that Britain's Bar Chart is on the far right, indicating strong opposition to vaccines. This is the advantage of Diverging Stack Bar Chart.


-__I have an idea to separate the neutral part and make a bar chart, so that the effect of diverging bar chart will be better.__ I will try to show it is possible to present in the final dashboard.
