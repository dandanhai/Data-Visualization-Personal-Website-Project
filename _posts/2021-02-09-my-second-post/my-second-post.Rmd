# a.	Critique of Data Visualization
```{r, out.width='90%',fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('picture/example.png')
```

### **Clarity**
- Apart from Strongly Agree and Strongly Disagree, the other three categories are not expressed the meaning, so accurate information from the legend cannot be obtained.

- As 100% stacked bar chart, comparing the middle three categories among those countries are difficult.

- Reading the percentage value of strongly disagree is difficult. Also reading the percentage value of the sum of strongly disagree and category 4 is difficult

- As 100% stacked bar chart, it is not clear how much support each country has for vaccines

- The bar chart on the right is clear and easy to understand, but it is too simple

### **Aesthetic**

- The distribution of the colors is not consistent enough. Strongly Agree/Strongly Agree should be used more brighten color.

- Legend on the right top corner is vague.

- It is not a excellent data visualization since I want to compare different country's opinion on pro-vaccine. So I believe it is better to change to diverging stacked bar chart in the view of comparison.

- The initial letter of country name is in lower case in both chart, which is not professional.

# b.	Way to Improve Current Design
### **Improve from Clarity**

- Add “2”, “3”, and “4” can be modified to “2 – Agree”, “3 – Neutral”, and “4 – Disagree” at the right legend to convenient the audience to understand

- Diverging stacked bar chart is more suitable with the comparison

- Add the reference line in the bar chart on the right

### **Improve from Aesthetics**

- Use a more distinct color, gradient from red to dark blue

- It is recommended to use diverging stacked bar chart and create Gantt Percent, which can represent the each category with better data visualization.

- Change the initial letter of country name in upper case.

### **Sketch of Proposed Design** 


```{r, out.width='80%',fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('picture/sketch.jpeg')
```
- We can clearly see from the figure that Britain's Bar Chart is on the far right, indicating strong opposition to vaccines. This is the advantage of Diverging Stack Bar Chart. Also, I added a clear legend to make the audience easy to visualize the chart. The progression of colors also has a visual effect, such as strong agree is red and agree is pink


-__I have an idea to separate the neutral part and make a bar chart, so that the effect of diverging bar chart will be better.__ I will try to show it is possible to present in the final dashboard.
