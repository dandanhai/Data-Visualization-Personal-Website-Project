### **Clarity**
- Apart from Strongly Agree and Strongly Disagree, the other three categories are not expressed, so accurate information cannot be obtained.

- As 100% stacked bar chart, comparing the middle three categories iamoung those countries are difficult.

- Reading the percentage value of strongly disagree is difficult

- Reading the percentage value of the sum of strongly disagree and category 4 is difficult
