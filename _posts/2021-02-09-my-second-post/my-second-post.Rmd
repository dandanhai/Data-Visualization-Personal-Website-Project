```

#  **1.	Critique of Data Visualization**
```{r, out.width='90%',fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('picture/example.png')
```

### **1.1 Clarity**
- Apart from Strongly Agree and Strongly Disagree, the other three categories are not expressed the meaning, so accurate information from the legend cannot be obtained.

- As 100% stacked bar chart, comparing the middle three categories among those countries are difficult.

- Reading the percentage value of strongly disagree is difficult. Also reading the percentage value of the sum of strongly disagree and category 4 is difficult

- As 100% stacked bar chart, it is not clear how much support each country has for vaccines

- The bar chart on the right is clear and easy to understand, but it is too simple

### **1.2 Aesthetic**

- The distribution of the colors is not consistent enough. Strongly Agree/Strongly Agree should be used more brighten color.

- Legend on the right top corner is vague.

- It is not a excellent data visualization since I want to compare different country's opinion on pro-vaccine. So I believe it is better to change to diverging stacked bar chart in the view of comparison.

- The initial letter of country name is in lower case in both chart, which is not professional.

##	Way to Improve Current Design

### **1.3 Improve from Clarity**

- Add “2”, “3”, and “4” can be modified to “2 – Agree”, “3 – Neutral”, and “4 – Disagree” at the right legend to convenient the audience to understand

- Diverging stacked bar chart is more suitable with the comparison

- Add the reference line in the bar chart on the right

### **1.4 Improve from Aesthetics**

- Use a more distinct color, gradient from red to dark blue

- It is recommended to use diverging stacked bar chart and create Gantt Percent, which can represent the each category with better data visualization.

- Change the initial letter of country name in upper case.

#  **2 Sketch of Proposed Design** 

###  **2.1 Sketch**
```{r, out.width='80%',fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('picture/sketch.jpeg')
```
###  **2.2 Advantages of Propose Design**

- We can clearly see from the figure that Britain's Bar Chart is on the far right, indicating strong opposition to vaccines. This is the advantage of Diverging Stack Bar Chart. Also, I added a clear legend to make the audience easy to visualize the chart. The progression of colors also has a visual effect, such as strong agree is red and agree is pink


-__I have an idea to separate the neutral part and make a bar chart, so that the effect of diverging bar chart will be better.__ I will try to show it is possible to present in the final dashboard.


#  **3 Step -by-step Description on Data Visualization Design Process**

### **3.1 Data Preparetion

1. Import Data into Tableau and union all the data


```{r, out.width='20%',fig.align='left'}
knitr::include_graphics('picture/1.PNG')
```

2. View the column and hide redundant column

```{r, out.width='50%',fig.align='left'}
knitr::include_graphics('picture/2.PNG')
```

3. Split [Table Name] and render the column name as [country]

```{r, out.width='30%',fig.align='left'}
knitr::include_graphics('picture/3.PNG')
```

Tableau can help us break up the whole column with ' . '.

```{r, out.width='50%',fig.align='left'}
knitr::include_graphics('picture/5.PNG')
```

Now we get the clean country column.

4. Use Create Calculated Field to redefine [vac_1]

```{r, out.width='50%',fig.align='left'}
knitr::include_graphics('picture/4.PNG')
```

Formula is 6-int(left([vac_1],1)). The reason for using this formula is that I want strong disagreement and agreement to be shown as negative axis in the diverging stacked bar

5. Create Number of record, Total count and Percentage column

```{r, out.width='50%',fig.align='left'}
knitr::include_graphics('picture/6.PNG')
knitr::include_graphics('picture/7.PNG')
knitr::include_graphics('picture/8.PNG')
```


6. Create Total count negative, Total count and Gantt Start column

```{r, out.width='50%',fig.align='left'}
knitr::include_graphics('picture/9.PNG')
knitr::include_graphics('picture/10.PNG')
```

```{r, out.width='70%',fig.align='left'}
knitr::include_graphics('picture/11.PNG')
```

7. Create Gantt Percentage

```{r, out.width='70%',fig.align='left'}
knitr::include_graphics('picture/12.PNG')
```

Explanation :ZN(expression) returns the expression if it is not null, otherwise returns zero. Use this function to use zero values instead of null values. 

 
### **3.2 Data Visualization

1. Change score into dimension

```{r, out.width='70%',fig.align='left'}
knitr::include_graphics('picture/13.PNG')
```


2. Aliases Score and Country Column

```{r, out.width='80%',fig.align='left'}
knitr::include_graphics('picture/15.PNG')
```

```{r, out.width='50%',fig.align='left'}
knitr::include_graphics('picture/16.PNG')
```

Now we can see that in this score column 1 stands for Strongly Disagree and 2 stands for Agree. At the same time, we revised the first capital letter of each country, which make it looks more formal.

3.Drag score to Fliters, Grand Percentage to Column and country to Row

```{r, out.width='80%',fig.align='left'}
knitr::include_graphics('picture/17.PNG')
```

```{r, out.width='30%',fig.align='left'}
knitr::include_graphics('picture/18.PNG')
```

At the same time of this step, we set Chart as Gantt Bar.

4.Drag Percentage to Size and Country to Detail

```{r, out.width='80%',fig.align='left'}
knitr::include_graphics('picture/19.PNG')
```

```{r, out.width='30%',fig.align='left'}
knitr::include_graphics('picture/20.PNG')
```

While we are doing this, we set up the colors and choose an appropriate theme for color.

5. Add household size, gender and employment status to dig insight information

```{r, out.width='30%',fig.align='left'}
knitr::include_graphics('picture/21.PNG')
```

Finally, it was found that household size had an obvious impact on attitudes towards vaccines，so we retained this Filters.

#### Dashboard 1

1. Add title
Add title : “Willingness of the public on Covid-19 vaccination from different countries and hoursehold size” with green background

2. Add commentary
**Using Objects > Text > drag to bottom of title and add:
“Although labour force participation rate (LPFR) across all age groups has increased from 2009 to 2019, the significant increase in older workers' (55-64 and 65+) participation has shifted the labour force’s distribution towards an older labour force. This shift is due to multitude of reasons, namely aging population due to low birth rates, extended retirement age, longer average lifespan, etc.”**


3. Add source
Using Objects > Text > drag to bottom left and add :
“Source: Ministry of Manpower Singapore (https://www.mom.gov.sg/)
Original report:https://stats.mom.gov.sg/Pages/Labour-Force-In-Singapore-2019.aspx
The raw data: https://stats.mom.gov.sg/Pages/Labour-Force-Tables2019.aspx”

4. Add author
Add text to bottom left corner and add text : “DataViz Makeover #1 by @suyiinang” align left.
