#  **1.	Critique of Data Visualization**

```{r, out.width='100%',fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('picture/1.PNG')
```



### **1.1 Clarity Issue**
- The color matching of the map ignores the problem of red-green colorblindness, which seems to be a small problem. However, there are an estimated 300 million colorblind people worldwide. 
- There is a lot of useful information in our dataset, but when we open Tableau Public and look at the information for each location, there is very little information in Tooltips.
- In the line chart on the right, the range of Y-axis is different, which may easily lead to misunderstanding.

- One great advantages of using line chart is to show tendency, while bar chart can better show distribution.

- In fact, in the map on the left, if you look at it alone, you can only find differences in the density distribution, and you can't really get anything more insight.

### **1.2 Aesthetic Issue**
- The color of the map is too dark, it is not aesthetically pleasing, we can try a different background.

- The figure on the right looks particularly messy and does not compare trends in each column. Can not get obvious information.

- The colors on the right are also very monotonous. Can try to enrich a simple line chart

### **1.3 Improve from Clarity**

- Change the green and replace it with dark brown for easily distinct purpose.

```{r, out.width='40%',fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('picture/change_color.PNG')
```

- Add notes and subtypes to tooltips so that viewers can click on each location to see more information on each conflict.
- Change the Y-axis to the same value to avoid misleading.
- A bar chart can be used to show the distribution with the Y axis as the country and the X axis as the event type
- Add a map, aggregate all the cases, and then divide them by countries. By comparing the size of the circle, the conflict degree of each country can be obtained

### **1.4 Improve from Aesthetics**
- In Tableau, click Map Background Function and change it as 'outdoors'.

- Can do it in Tableau by dragging Event Type into color square box, but it is best to use with bar chart instead of line chart.
- Add a pie chart to the tooltip to show the proportion of event types for each country.
